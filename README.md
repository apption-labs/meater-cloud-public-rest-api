## What You'll Need

* MEATER wireless thermometer. Get yours from the [MEATER store](https://meater.com/shop).
* MEATER Cloud account.

## API Basics

* Endpoint: `https://public-api.cloud.meater.com/v1`
* Rate limit:
  * Recommended: 2 requests per 60 seconds.
  * Maximum: 60 requests per 60 seconds.
* Slow Down:
  * To complement the rate limit, requests are automatically slowed down once 10% of rate limit is reached.
  * Delay: Up to `1.0` second per request.
* Authentication:
  * JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used.
  * Make a request to the `/login` endpoint to obtain a token.
  * Authenticated requests are made with the header `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`
  * The JWT doesn't expire but may be reset.
* Localisation:
  * English (US) is the default.
  * Cook names can be translated (unless cook was given a name by the user) using the `Accept-Language` header with the [ISO_639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code. For example `Accept-Language: fr`.
  * The API supports languages supported by the MEATER app.

## Status Codes and Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and also includes them in the JSON response in the `status` and `statusCode` attributes.

### Standard Response

Example:

```json
{
    "status": "200 OK",
    "statusCode": 200,
    "data": {},
    "meta": {}
}
```

### Error Response

* 400 Bad Request
* 404 Not Found
* 429 Too Many Requests
* 500 Internal Server Error

Example:

```json
{
    "status": "404 Not Found",
    "statusCode": 404,

}
```

  "password": "<MEATER Cloud Password>"
}'
```

### [GET] /devices

Devices (aka MEATER probes) will only be returned after the following criteria is met. There may be a delay between the MEATER Cloud seeing your device and it being returned in this endpoint.

* Device must be seen by the MEATER Cloud. Ensure you've completed a cook while connected to MEATER Cloud.
* The MEATER app or Block must have an active Bluetooth connection with the device.
* The MEATER app or Block must have an active MEATER Cloud connection.

Additional information:

* All temperatures are Celsius.
* `cook.temperature.internal`: Internal temperature.
* `cook.temperature.ambient`: Ambient temperature. If `ambient` is less than `internal`, `ambient` will equal `internal`.
* `cook.time.elapsed`: Time since the start of cook in seconds. Default: `0`.
* `cook.time.remaining`: Remaining time in seconds. When unknown/calculating default is used. Default: `-1`.
* `updated_at`: Time data was last updated at as a UNIX timestamp.

```text
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```
